## What This "Virus" Actually Does

ts isn’t a real virus

It js:

* overloads each core with a useless loop
* Burns your processor 🔥
* **Crashes your system *once*** (it will not actually work like the black plague)
* Comes with a **GUI** because i believe malware should have ✨ aesthetics ✨

So yeah, **very experimental, very silly, very fun**.


## Features

* ## *smegsy* CPU overload
* super cool Tkinter GUI wowowowow
* engineered for people who like ## devan

If you *do* know what you're doing:

## Final Warning

Running this will prolly:

* Freeze your PC
* Crash your OS
* Make your fans sound like a jet
* Cause you to contemplate your life choices
